# Create TF statistic features

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook used to create the following Text-Fabric features:

  - [num_words](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/features/num_words.html): Number of word nodes below this node.
  - [lemma_ttr](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/features/lemma_ttr.html): Type to Token Ratio based on lemma for all word nodes under this node.
  - [morph_ttr](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/features/morph_ttr.html): Type to Token Ratio based on morph-tag for all word nodes under this node.
  - [text_ttr](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/features/text_ttr.html): Type to Token Ratio based on wordform for all word nodes under this node.

More statistic features may be added in the future.
   
The final feature files will be added to the package available at the [tonyjurg/N1904addons](https://tonyjurg.github.io/N1904addons/) repository.

## About Text-Fabric

The Text-Fabric framework is designed to facilitate the analysis and manipulation of large-scale textual data, particularly in the context of ancient languages and biblical texts. The engine of Text-Fabric is its powerful Python library, which provides a comprehensive set of tools for processing and querying structured text data efficiently. The software package is accessible at [https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric](https://github.com/annotation/text-fabric).
